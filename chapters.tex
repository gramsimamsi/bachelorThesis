\chapter{Introduction}
With this chapter, the reader should be able to comprehend why this thesis was written, what it tries to accomplish and which topics are considered in this work.

\section{Motivation}

The increasing amount of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions, cloud-hosted environments and
microservice architectures introduces new attack scenarios. This creates the need for new defense
strategies in both Development and Operations. Especially solutions providing (Kubernetes
conformant) container orchestration are identifiably different and in high demand compared to long
established solutions. This calls for a more detailed, focused examination. \\

\section{Objective}

This thesis aims to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}

\item What generic security risks emerge when providing or using a multi-tenant PaaS solution,
with each tenant developing, deploying and running their own applications? 

\item How can a PaaS provider (serving internal and/or external users) mitigate those risks? 

\item  In this scope and from a PaaS provider viewpoint, how does an on-premise solution compare
to a public cloud solution? 

\end{itemize}

Another goal is to recommend security measures for different implementation use cases.

Possible measures to mitigate those risks will also be explored, evaluated and (if possible) put to use in the practical examples. 
With the results gathered, the thesis will compare different best practice implementations for different use cases and recommend measures for each.

\section{Scope limitation}

%TODO: deriving scenarios from goal%

To achieve the aforementioned goals, the view on the problem is limited to a manageable scope by
focusing on specific components of a few commonly used (Certified Kubernetes) PaaS solutions.
These components will be OpenShift Container Platform for On-Premise use cases and Azure Kubernetes Service as a public cloud solution. \\
Components providing Kubernetes conformity will be the main focus, as these bear the most significance across all Kubernetes Certified solutions. \\
A look at popular tools and frameworks used in such clusters will be avoided in order to keep the scope manageable, though some might be recommended as a mitigation.\\
This thesis aims to provide insight to the risks of providing a PaaS solution and mitigations thereof. 
As such, it will look at the capabilities a potential provider has to (mis-)configure such solutions - inherent risks of the technologies themselves are only explored when measures to mitigate them are accessible from a provider standpoint. \\
In short, the goal is to improve the security of your Kubernetes cluster, not Kubernetes itself.\\
Looking at three common attack scenarios, it will then determine vulnerabilities and attack vectors,
as well as their potential damage and rate those risks:

\begin{itemize}

\item Malicious third party attacking the underlying infrastructure from within the LAN and/or the internet

\item Malicious third party attacking from inside a hijacked container, i.e. remotely executing code or commands

\item Bad user, i.e. a negligent, hijacked or malicious developer (account) risking compromise of his own and/or other applications

\end{itemize}

In order to achieve a view on the risks more accurately resembling situations where a solution might be implemented, several assumptions are made:

\begin{itemize}

\item People in contact with the solution are familiar with conventional security principles and measures, but are new to the technologies used in the solutions within scope. They might even be new to container and cloud solutions in general. This includes both users of the solution like developers and project managers, as well as operators and administrators.

\item It is assumed that no special requirements like industry-specific compliance requirements have to be followed and the workloads processed within the solution have no exceptionally high security requirements. 

\item Regarding the design and implementation of applications running on the solutions, it is assumed that conventional application security measures have been implemented, i.e. against the OWASP Top 10 (SOURCE: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).\\
	The extent of those measures is assumed to be in accordance to moderate criticality of the data and service provided by the application.

\item Some risks increase or decrease drastically, depending on many specific configurations. Considering the high system complexity, ``getting it to work'' is hard enough for users and operators new to these technologies. (SOURCE: https://youtu.be/vTgQLzeBfRU?t=185)  \\
	When setting up and configuring a setup, the default configurations are left as-is whenever possible. Guidelines of specific implementations are followed, but whenever measures are presented as optional and not required, they will be skipped. \\
	Before recommending security measures, the setup will be modified just enough to become functional, without regards to the security implementations.

\item Multiple tenants like different customers, teams or projects are separated by kubernetes namespaces, not different clusters. This assumption will be compared to tenant isolation by cluster separation in section X (TODO: HEADING LINK TO TENANT ISOLATION HERE).

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Theory}
With this chapter, a reader with foundational knowledge of topics regarding Computer Science and/or Informatics should be able to grasp the specialized technologies discussed within the thesis and familiarize themselves with the definitions and terminology used throughout this thesis.

\section{Infrastructure-as-a-Service}
In \gls{iaas} environments, a consumer trusts his \gls{iaas} provider with the management and control of the infrastructure needed to deploy his applications.
The provided service ends at provisioning or processing, storage, networks and other computing resources \cite{nistcloud}
(TODO Quelle: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf ). 
Therefore consumers do not need to manage their own data centers or topics like system uplink availability.
As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:servicecomparison}, consumers are responsible for the \gls{os} layer and everything above it.

(TODO: you manage <-> other manages https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/ )

\section{Platform-as-a-Service}

In \gls{paas} environments, a consumer trusts his \gls{paas} provider with the management and control of even more resources needed to deploy his applications beyond those covered by \gls{iaas}. 
(TODO Quelle: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf )
In an ideal scenario, this leads to a consumer not having to concern himself with the underlying network, hardware, servers, operating systems, storage or even common middleware like log data collection and analysis 
(TODO Quelle: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/ )
 and allows him to focus on other tasks, i.e. application development. As a downside to this, a consumer might only have limited control on, among others, the software installed on the  machines provisioned. 
Although this shifts some of the responsibility burden towards the provider, the situation isn't as clear-cut as one might think. 
Figure X  (TODO: Picture link) shows middleware and runtime as provided, but there is no clear standard on what capabilities or tools are included.
A consumer might require capabilities which aren't provided or wishes to avoid provider lock-in through proprietary tools, again resulting in middleware responsibilities for the consumer. 
A consumer might also have to extensively configure the application-hosting environment for compliance or security purposes. 
Even some low-level tasks aren't completely managed, i.e. \gls{vm} reboots to apply security updates.

components: kubernetes dashboard, kubernetes apiserver, OCP web console, 


TODO

\subsection{Read confidentials through Kubernetes control plane interfaces}
Gather confidential information through the Kubernetes dashboard & apiserver (platform interfaces are evaluated separately)
TODO

\subsection{Change configuration through Kubernetes control plane interfaces}

\subsection{Compromise internal k8s control plane components (etcd, scheduler, controller-manager)}
This vector comprises reconaissance, leaks of confidentials and configuration changes through Kubernetes components not intended to be accessible: etcd stores, kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager
TODO

\subsection{Supply compromised container (base) image}
Supplying a malicious container image leading to security violations on the cluster (remote access for an attacker, resource misuse, data leakage, …). Most easily done untargeted (dockerhub images or dockerfiles on tutorials/help forums), but can be done targeted, too. Additionally, an image build process typically runs as root, leading to compromise possibilities to compromise the node where an image is built from a rogue dockerfile. (TODO: provoking stale image usage to exploit vulns, too?)
TODO

\subsection{Supply compromised k8s configuration}
Supplying a malicious kubernetes configuration leading to security violations on the cluster (remote access for an attacker, resource misuse, data leakage, …). Most easily done untargeted (tutorials/ help forums), but can be done targeted, too.
TODO

\subsection{Compromise other application components (lateral movement)}
Once an attacker gains access to a container, he may try to access more lucrative application components or information, i.e. sniffing traffic or accessing databases or containers with more confidential information/traffic.
TODO

\subsection{Container breakout (R/W, Privilege Escalation)}
Once inside a container, an attacker may try to gain access to the underlying host by a multitude of means. This includes invoking syscalls, accessing the host file system and elevation priviledges within or outside of the container environment
TODO

\subsection{Compromise local image cache}
If the cached image of a container can be manipulated, another container (which might even seem to fulfill the same function) violating security principles could be started.
TODO

\subsection{Modify running container}
Once inside a container, an attacker may try to modify the container to exfiltrate data or better suit their needs for further intrusion
TODO

\subsection{Misuse node resources (sabotage, cryptojacking)}

TODO

\subsection{Hoard orchestration resources (sabotage)}
The resources of the whole cluster may be misconfigured or misused to disrupt service availability (i.e. through fork bombing or misconfiguration)
TODO

\subsection{Misuse orchestration resources (cryptojacking)}
The resources of the whole cluster may be misconfigured or misused for financial gains (mining cryptocurrencies)
TODO

\subsection{Add malicious container}
A malicious container may be started within the cluster
TODO

\subsection{Add malicious node}
A malicious node may be added to the cluster
TODO

\subsection{Bad user practice (outside of cluster)}
This vector comprises user practices outside of the cluster that lead to risks within it. Examples include phishing, openly publishing keys/tokens to public code repositories and more.
TODO

\subsection{Incufficient base infrastructure hardening}
The underlying nodes could allow an attacker easy entry, even if the containers themselves are hardened
%TODO: also other (external) parts of company infrastructure
TODO

\subsection{Entry through known, unpatched vulnerabilities}
Every system has to be kept up to date with  security patches. Publicly known vulnerabilities might otherwise be exploited, leading to potentially devastating violations of security principles
TODO


\chapter{Assessing the attack surface risk}
%TODO: derive process/evolution of risk rating model, introduce rating by threat actors + tools + vector + platform, explain problems / inaccuracies%

\section{Defining procedures and approach}

%START OLD STUFF, REVISIT%
Focus on three scenarios: attack through network, hijacked container, bad user

Research-Freeze: May 3rd, 2019! (Pre-KubeCon19, check git commit dates for stuff like OWASP-documents etc!)
Some newer information might be used for big outliers, but everything else just gets a side note

RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:
difficulties with: 
A how generically should vectors be set?
B how to structure vectors (into categories?) 

Solution to A: vectors split and merged after risk assessment sketch; if there were considerable differences in the estimated values, they were split. If no diffs, they were merged.
Solution to B: Considerable time invested, no optimal solution was found. Ultimately ignored this, since more time investment wasnt feasible or added much value to the goals. TODO: Explain process, what was looked at and why it wasnt good, how we arrived at the end structure.

Risk assessment formula:
Risk = Probability * Impact.
Impact was taken as single value of 1 through 3  and estimated through None/Theoretical (0), Low/Intermediate-Step (1), non-severe security principle violation (2), severe security principle violation (3)

Probability was a bitch to define proberly. Therefore split into four factors: Vantage Point, Required Access Level (RAL), Detectability and Exploitability. Those initially had values between 0 though 3, but outlier values of 4  were defined for RAL and Vantage Point (in sync with existing assessment methodologies within HvS).
The average of these four values is taken as the total propability value, ranging from 0.25 through 3.5 (low <= 1.25, medium <= 2.25).
Vantage Point: physical access (0, see above since your own or the cloud providers hardware-accessing employees can also do whatever they want); node or management-interface (1); within container (2); within company network (3); from public www (4)
Required Access Level: cloud/infrastructure admin (0, since a rogue employee with super-admin can do whatever they want and this is about baseline security); cluster/system-admin (1); cluster/system user with read/write access (2); cluster/system user with read-only access (3); unauthenticated (4)
Detectability: Difficult (1) since it needs custom tools for environment-specific vuln detction; Average (2) since it is either generic but needs simple custom tools or its individualized but can be identified with some slight tool individualization; Easy (3) since there are generic script-kiddie tools / GUI-paths to find the vuln
Exploitability: Theoretical (0, since this is the level of unpublished 0-days and we are still doing baseline security); difficult (1) needs custom tools for environment-specific exploitation; Average(2), since its a generic exploit but needs simple custom tools or its inividualized but can be exploited with some slight tool individualization; Easy (3) since there are generic script-kiddie tools / GUI-paths to exploit the vuln

This leads to a total risk of 0 through 10.5, which is then rounded to full integers and capped at 10. In accordance to HvS internal models, total risk values <= 3 are defined as low, <= 6 as medium and values above that are defined as high.

specific values for each vector are estimated in a context with multiple assumptions:
TODO: callback to assumptions in scope limitation

- If multiple techniques can be used / impacts can occur to leverage a vector, all factor values of the one with the highest total risk are taken
- Values might decrease through the implementation of security measures, leading to a lower total value. (If multiple techniques could be used to leverage a vector and only one gets its total risk reduced, the new maximum risk value of that vector becomes the vector value(s)

goal is to reduce values above threshold X to below threshold X by applying security measures. This aims to ensure a basic security level, not something against APT groups / zero-day protection / targeted attacks with a lot of resources and competence. (no online banking, user data of average confidentiality etc)

Default values are defined as the following:

SETUP OF PRACTICAL PART:

Version freeze:
OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 -> OKD 3.11 ->  k8s-version = 1.11(.0 with fixes, is a fork. see: https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.11.0 )
AKS (on May 3rd 2019) => k8s-version <= v1.13.5 available, but only for k8s-v1.11 only 1.11.8 or 1.11.9!

Considerable changes between 1.11.0 and 1.11.9 (Source: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md):
- action required: the API server and client-go libraries have been fixed to support additional non-alpha-numeric characters in UserInfo "extra" data keys. Both should be updated in order to properly support extra data containing "/" characters or other characters disallowed in HTTP headers. (#65799, @dekkagaijin)
- https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/tag/cluster-autoscaler-1.3.1
- ACTION REQUIRED: Removes defaulting of CSI file system type to ext4. All the production drivers listed under https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/Drivers.html were inspected and should not be impacted after this change. If you are using a driver not in that list, please test the drivers on an updated test cluster first. ``` (#65499, @krunaljain)
- kube-apiserver: the Priority admission plugin is now enabled by default when using --enable-admission-plugins. If using --admission-control to fully specify the set of admission plugins, the Priority admission plugin should be added if using the PodPriority feature, which is enabled by default in 1.11. (#65739, @liggitt)
The system-node-critical and system-cluster-critical priority classes are now limited to the kube-system namespace by the PodPriority admission plugin. (#65593, @bsalamat)

no major changes => OCP 3.11, AKS-k8s 1.11.9!

Dependency compatibilities:
OCP 3.11: docker 1.13, CRI-O 1.11 (Source: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/release_notes/ocp_3_11_release_notes.html#ocp-311-about-this-release)
k8s-1.11: docker 1.11.2 to 1.13.1  (Source: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md#external-dependencies), CRI-O 1.11 (in-synch to k8s releases, source: https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o)
Azure-AKS: uses moby, NOT docker! (moby = pluggable container runtime based on docker, automatically updated in background whenever no node restart needed)

-> take defaults for all dependencies on install, document and apply all AKS node updates needing manual restart!
